### Hello there, I'm Haifaa

I'm a junior Software developer who enjoys researching and solving real world problems with programming.

* I've had hands on experience with Python (Pandas, Flask, PyTorch) and JavaScript (React, Node.js).
* I'm proficient in Java (Junit, Dependency managment) and C (Research & Academics).

I'm currently working on researching the application of supervised machine learning and convolutional neural networks to analyze and diagnose radiology scans.

I'm passionate about fiber arts, nature, and poetry.
